 • Patient Management: Add new patients and edit their details.
 • Visit Management: Schedule new visits, view past visits, and assign treatments.
 • Visit History: View all past visits and see details of specific visits.

### Why I Chose This Project

 • State Management Practice: I want to practice using Bloc/Cubit or Riverpod for managing app state.
 • Firebase Integration: I want to learn how to connect to Firebase and use its data.
 • Clean Architecture: This project will help me practice the clean architecture pattern.
 • Using Multiple Packages: I’ll get experience using various Flutter packages.
